# Improving Accuracy on make_circles Dataset Using TensorFlow

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to train a neural network using TensorFlow and `tf.keras.Sequential` to classify data generated by `sklearn.datasets.make_circles`. Initially, the model achieves only **48% accuracy**, but with improvements, we push it to **99% accuracy**. The progress is visualized using multiple graphs to understand the learning process.

## 📊 Dataset: `make_circles`
The dataset consists of two interleaving circles, making it a **non-linearly separable problem**. This requires a more sophisticated model than a simple linear classifier.

### Dataset Characteristics:
- **Features:** 2D points (`X` values)
- **Labels:** Binary classification (`y` values: 0 or 1)
- **Noise Factor:** Adjusted to introduce randomness
- **Visualization:** Scatter plot to show class distribution

## 🏗 Model Architecture
We use `tf.keras.Sequential` to build a neural network:
- **Input Layer:** 2 neurons (since input data is 2D)
- **Hidden Layers:** Multiple layers with increasing complexity
- **Activation Functions:** ReLU for hidden layers, Sigmoid for output
- **Loss Function:** Binary Crossentropy (since it’s a binary classification problem)
- **Optimizer:** Adam (for efficient learning)

### Initial Model (48% Accuracy)
- Small architecture with fewer neurons
- No proper learning rate tuning
- No dropout or batch normalization

### Improved Model (99% Accuracy)
- Increased complexity in hidden layers
- More neurons per layer
- Regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization)
- Proper weight initialization and learning rate tuning

## 📈 Visualizations & Graphs
We visualize various aspects of training:
- **Initial Data Distribution:** How classes are arranged
- **Training Loss & Accuracy:** How the model improves over epochs
- **Decision Boundary:** Before and after model improvement


## 📌 Results
| Model Version       | Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------|
| Initial Model      | 48%      |
| Improved Model     | 99%      |

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- Experiment with **different optimizers** (SGD, RMSprop, etc.)
- Use a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to test its effect
- Implement **Ensemble Learning** for better generalization
- Deploy as a web app for live testing
